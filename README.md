# Project.CleanCircle
The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a complex process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which is not compatible with the present day technologies.
Thus this project is to stimulate a waste management system using Python.

Bin_01.py , Bin_02.py , Bin_03.py , Bin_04.py all are to take measurements from 4 bins in form of their filled waste filled level.

Server.py implements a server for these 4 bins mentioned and it outputs in a way like giving results showing which Bin needs to be emptied using a threshold of 80%.
